# My Actor Webpage
This will be my own personal Actor's Webpage that I can use to showcase my work and keep
people up to date with my career so far.

# UX
## User Stories
As a user I would like:

* To instantly have visual confirmation of what the actor looks like.
* To be able to view some of the actor's work.
* To be able to easily navigate through the actor's webpage.
* To read some basic information about the actors training and work history.
* To have access to contact information for possible collaboration.

## Design
  **Wire Frames**
  
  The webpage was designed using 
  Balsamiq to crate some basic 
  wireframes(Link below)
  
  [Wireframes](wireframes.md)


**Colours**



**Typography**
I used the "Goldman" font for all my heading as I felt it really
mad the the text stand out.


**Backgrounds**

The background for the header is a photo of the actor(me) and was chosen to 
instantly show off the actor in his working environment.

# Features
## Exsisting Features
* Header - with the actors name, a nav menu and a photo of the actor.
* Showreel - a section with a video which showcases the actors work.
* Gallery - an interactive photo galler in the form of a carousel
* Links - buttons and links that lead you to the actors other profiles, webpages and social media.
