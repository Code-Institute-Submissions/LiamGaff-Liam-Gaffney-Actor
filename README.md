# Actor Webpage
This will be my own personal Actor's Webpage that has been designed to showcase my work and keep
people up to date with my career so far.

# UX

## Users
The users that will visit my webpage are gooing to consist of other actors and casting agents. Because of this I didn't over populate my webpage with content, I kept it simple and only provided the necessary information.

## User Stories
As a user I would like:

* To instantly have visual confirmation of what the actor looks like.
* To be able to view some of the actor's work.
* To be able to easily navigate through the actor's webpage.
* To read some basic information about the actors training and work history.
* To have access to the actors contact information for possible collaboration.
* To be able to contact the actor directly through the webpage.

## Design
  **Wire Frames**
  
  The webpage was designed using 
  Balsamiq to crate some basic 
  wireframes(Link below)
  
  [Wireframes](../wireframes.md)


**Colours**

* I used a turquoise (#56c1c1) colour for all my headings as i felt it matched nicely with my hero image.

* The rest of the text was then either a simple shade of white or blue to blend nicely with the rest of the content and dark background.

**Typography**

* I used the "Goldman" font for all my heading as I felt it really made the the text stand out.
* I then used "Roboto-Condensed" for the rest of my text as it seemed to pair nicely with the Goldman.

**Backgrounds**

* The background for the header is a photo of the actor(me) and was chosen to instantly show off the actor in his working environment.
* The rest of the page was give a navy blue colour (#243c56). This made the rest of the content stand out to the user.

# Features
## Exsisting Features
* Header - with the actors name, a nav menu and a photo of the actor.
* Showreel - a section with a video which showcases the actors work.
* Gallery - an interactive photo galler in the form of a carousel.
* Links - buttons and links that lead you to the actors other profiles, webpages and social media.
* Form - a contact form to contact the actor directly through the webpage.

## Features Still to Be Implemented
* An external page is to be added that will contain a blog and videos of different scenes and monologues.

# Testing
As the webpage was being built Chrome developer tools were used to ensure that the code was working smoothly. Each section was then tested agin every time a new feature was added.

Post-deployment the webpage was tested across a number of devices to ensure it remained responsive.

**Bugs**

Most bugs I encountered were solved through the use of Bootstrap or were simple mistakes that were easily fixd in my CSS.

* Carousel 
> I originally encountered an issue with carousel that I got from Bootstrap, this was mainly to do with it's positioning . This problem was fixed using the flex utility from Bootstrap.
  Also the photos that were added to the gallery had to be adjusted to fit within the carousel.
* Gallery Section 
>After I corrected the carousel position it seemed that a new problem had arose. When viewing the site on a view port bigger than 720px the sections would collapse in on top of eachother. This problem was fixed by simply adjusting the height of all the sections

*  Nav 
> I had to return to my nav as it seemed that it would move out of place when i viewed the webpage on a mobile device. Once again this was fixed using the flex utility from Bootstrap.
(The nav toggler icon currently moves up and down when clicked on. I am still trying to correct this issue.)
