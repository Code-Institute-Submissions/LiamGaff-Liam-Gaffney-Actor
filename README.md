# My Actor Webpage
This will be my own personal Actor's Webpage that I can use to showcase my work and keep
people up to date with my career so far.

# UX
## User Stories
As a user I would like:

* To instantly have visual confirmation of what the actor looks like.
* To be able to view some of the actor's work.
* To be able to easily navigate through the actor's webpage.
* To read some basic information about the actors training and work history.
* To have access to the actors contact information for possible collaboration.

## Design
  **Wire Frames**
  
  The webpage was designed using 
  Balsamiq to crate some basic 
  wireframes(Link below)
  
  [Wireframes](../wireframes.md)


**Colours**

* I used an aqua blue colour for all my headings as i felt it matched nicely with my hero image.

* The rest of the text was then either a simple shade of white or blue to blend nicely with the rest of the content and dark background.

**Typography**

* I used the "Goldman" font for all my heading as I felt it really made the the text stand out.
* I then used "Roboto-Condensed" for the rest of my text and it seemed to pair nicely with the Goldman

**Backgrounds**

* The background for the header is a photo of the actor(me) and was chosen to instantly show off the actor in his working environment.
* The rest of the page was give a darkish grey colour (#343a40). This made the rest of the content stand out to the user.

# Features
## Exsisting Features
* Header - with the actors name, a nav menu and a photo of the actor.
* Showreel - a section with a video which showcases the actors work.
